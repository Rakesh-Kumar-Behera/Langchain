            "the Galaxy s25 Ultra is the most enticing phone that Samsung has ever made the thing is addictively delightful to use I'd say this is the closest phone has ever come to being an iPhone killer but at the same time should you actually go out and buy one right now in most cases I would say no let me explain why so on one hand it's actually kind of hard to describe just how much I love using this thing I mean just from a technical materials perspective the glass being used on the front and back the now stronger Titanium on the body this is one tough phone I've been specifically using it without a case to test it and so far at least it's been in a camera bag it's been in backpacks pockets it's been embedded into our table during a failed intro I even painfully sat here rubbing my wedding ring against it and there is a little more dust collection than I would like but zero in the way of damage only thing that has unfortunately marked it is a pretty nasty meter and a half drop straight onto concrete but when I saw that happen I was bracing myself for a lot worse than this the battery life is even better than last year it's just under 9 hours of Total screen on time per charge when the screen is set to the default 10 P which means I'm reaching the end of my days with 30 to 40% left in the tank consistently but also is this not just like gorgeous it's like the precise looking design of the phone paired with this almost borderless display that's so vibrant so crisp and almost immune to Reflections to the point where you don't even need to turn the brightness High to see it clearly all topped off with easily Samsung's most beautiful software ever actually I'll tell you how you know that Samsung has hit the nail on the head with this one ui7 Android skin drisha why and lifetime iPhone user picked this phone up for the first time rolled it around in her hands scrolled for 5 minutes she looked at me and she said you know what I actually like this she has never said that before to me in the 5 years that we've been together but I can kind of see why she said it here it feels like this software is specifically designed to feel familiar to an iPhone user the icons and widgets are now more in line than ever the multitasking page is now practically identical the way that you can Now swipe down from the right to pull up your Control Center and then swipe down from the left to open a separate notifications tray the way that you customize your lock screen is like okay copy my homework and don't even worry about changing it would it be even better if Samsung had been more original maybe but here's the thing I actually think Samsung is pulling it off better than Apple I love how now when I'm browsing the settings I can just type approximately what a setting might be you know in human language and the phone understands what I'm looking for this used to be such a pain before cuz you need to remember exactly what the phone labels each specific setting as if you want to find it the Samsung photo gallery feels way more intuitive than Apples who's honestly just massacred their photos app in iOS 18 it's also way more intelligent like when I'm searching for past pictures it is spot-on it understands the assignment every time people always talk about maximum brightness oh dear God but I really like how dim the minimum brightness on this gets it's less strenuous on your eyes just before bed and the thing is just so fast you know the iPhone always has this implicit reputation as the smooth one the one that does animations right well I don't actually think that's the case anymore this Samsung feels blazing fast thanks to each animation being both very smooth like the iPhone while also being tuned to be quicker than Apples it gives the phone this feeling of instantaneousness that actually makes the Iphone feel slow by comparison so why on Earth would I not recommend that you run out and you buy this thing right now okay there's a few reasons in this moment you can get a Galaxy s24 Ultra brand spanking you for $800 whereas this is a $1,300 phone it's like 60% more expensive okay that's fine that happens every year and usually I am very much on the side of we use our phones so much why not just buy the latest one if you can afford it but this is one of the first cases where I'm still not convinced first of all I feel like I've made it pretty clear just how much I love Samsung's new Android skin but you should be getting practically the full one ui7 feature set on the s24 ultra 2 this new phone has an even faster chip than last year like significantly faster just to give you an idea we ran a 30-minute stress test on this s25 Ultra the s24 ultra before it and the iPhone 16 Pro Max and while the s25 ultra does have the lowest stability meaning that over the course of that 30 minutes it lost the most performance compared to where it started because of how high its starting point was even its lowest performance is still about 25% faster than the lowest of the other two phones but the thing is I can't find a way to actually use that power in my day-to-day life like I said the phone does just feel faster than last year but that's just the software that's not because of the Chip And in terms of games I wish the landscape was different I wish the top 50 games on the Play Store were all just super graphically intense massive 3d worlds but they're not to appeal to the widest pool of people most mobile games are developed to run on $100 phones so finding ones that actually benefit from this power is becoming quite a niche Endeavor you'll have to be specifically looking for them and then also you can have the most powerful chip in the world but especially on Android which is more often than not a victim of lazy developer syndrome some apps are just going to lag anyway so like I've been playing a lot of Pokémon TCG pocket recently it plays completely fine on the latest iPhone 60 frames per second hell it plays fine on an iPhone 12 but on the 2025 Flagship Samsung it lags I've noticed this with the Amazon app it's sloppily programmed I've noticed it with zoom calls like the Android app is just laggier and it seems to run the camera in much worse quality the list goes on my point being having this much power is absolutely incredible but I don't think the average person is going to notice compared to the s24 ultra because most of the bottl come down to software not hardware and then there is the AI part of the equation the majority of the appeal of this s25 Ultra more so than maybe any phone ever released is tied to AI we've been told this AI is only free till the end of 2025 but we still have no idea how much the AI is going to cost now I will say some of these new AI features are amazing like AI select Game Changer you know when someone sends you a whole paragraph and you just want to copy one sentence from that paragraph This solves it or the ability to quickly S screen grab something in a chat to resurface it to the top so incredible that I have mapped my AI select to come up when I double tap the side button hold to activate Gemini feels like a real step up from Google Assistant they finally figured out how to get Gemini to do all the basic stuff that the assistant was good at and so now the focus is just in what ways can it go further I think it still does need to go further I mean I really wish it could be a full phone assistant you know like call me on Uber to the shops find me a photo I took of Milo yesterday open the new Captain America trailer on YouTube it can't do any of those things right now from the home screen but still at least being able to now communicate with complex commands like what's a great restaurant in London for a group in which one person has a penology one person's a vegan and one person has celiac disease yeah that's usually what I'm working with I found vantra a restaurant that caters to your group's dietary needs and they are also mindful of peanut allergies and you can see why that is useful the ability to go one step further and pull up Gemini live with the context of what is on your screen that feels even more Next Level talk live about video oh never going to give you up so tell me why did this video become such a trend it's called Rick Rolling and it's a classic internet meme but why do you think this video specifically became the meme you know how sometimes the best memes are just so Random I think that's a big part of it it's catchy it's kind of goofy and that element of surprise makes people laugh that's actually the best answer I've had so far from anyone now I haven't quite figured out what exactly I'm going to do with this capability on a regular basis I guess most of what I watch on YouTube is entertainment which you'd rather talk about with another person instead of an AI but let's say you were watching for information you could see how it would be a really good way to get a quick summary of the video or to ask a clarifying question that the video maybe doesn't properly itself answer the AI wallpaper generation is now probably the best I've used on any phone it's fast it gives you some very high quality options that almost always look sharp on the phone's display and I love the way that the phone will instantly swap out the rest of the user interfaces color palette to match that said if you actually want to bang a wallpaper you're probably still better off hopping onto X and just searching for it I feel like the AI Generations they're like always 80% what you're looking for but they're way less likely to be the 100% oh yeah and the object eraser for photos is like wow this is actually better in my experience than even the one on the Google pixel it really does make the people and the objects in the background of your shots feel like they are being snapped out of existence now at the same time some of these AI features are not so good like all of these briefs that it keeps giving me on my lock screen my morning briefs are usually weather and here's what's coming up later today on my Google Calendar which sure okay I get how that might be useful but if I want my weather it is also on my home screen and then my evening check-ins are like even more weather which like I have a roof why do I care when I'm about to go to bed and then a reminder of today's Google events but again it's not like anyone's scheduling calls after 8:00 p.m. this stuff has already happened and then tomorrow's Google events cross app action the ability for two apps to communicate with each other also needs a couple of years in the oven I think but even then I I just don't think there's enough to it yet it's kind of as predicted the level of intelligence required to understand your request that exists but the level of intelligence required to understand the full context that surrounds your request is missing and without that it is practically useless like for example you can say to this phone when does the Pokémon popup come to London add it to my calendar and snap your fingers it's done title location timing everything but the Pokémon popup is open for four full days so how did it decide that this is the day that I'm going on and how did it decide what time I'm going to be there these are things that for this to be actually useful it needs to truly understand and to be able to run them by me like a real personal system would the Samsung now bar that sits on your lock screen feels kind of like Apple's Dynamic Island it's cool in concept it's executed in a slick way but without enough functionality or supported apps to really have any impact on the way that you use your phone like it's got some very specific sports that if you're into it can serve you up notifications that show you current game progress but like I'm not a massive Sports guy this only starts to become useful to me at the point where it can understand what I'm interested in just generally so let's say the fact that I open the Pokémon card app once per day that's an interest and then it can ping me when a new expansion goes alive within that game The Interpreter mode feels like in moments there's a sparkle sometimes it all just clicks and you're actually having an almost real- time conversation with someone in another language it's just that the vast majority of cases are more you see in real time on the screen that it is completely butchered the sentence that you're trying to say and you're out there scurrying to hit the stop button before it translates and you accidentally tell the other person to shave their cat oh yeah and then the ability to record calls with the additional perk to search through the transcript afterwards and AI summarize what you heard the seamless less and presentation of this feature is pure Superman it's just a shame that the execution is closer to the Joker the phone just does not seem to understand what you're saying and if it doesn't understand what's being said it doesn't matter if you can search through it or AI summarize it it's all gobbley and separately but while we are on the subject of dunking on this thing Samsung did a little sneaky here they have silently removed the Bluetooth functionality of the S Pen so you can't use it anymore to control your music using air gestures or your camera shutter can't say I ever really did much of either of those but it's still not a good look to see some things moving backwards like this anyway my main point was that yes there are still some actually new actually great AI features here it's just that with every single one of them you have to put three pretty large asterisks next to them like a some of these features like Circle to search and cross app action really they're Google features so other phones will get them too B A lot of the stuff will also be coming to past Samsung phones via updates and the biggest thing if all of these features are so Central to this s25 Ultra then how on Earth do we still have absolutely no idea how much they're going to cost us I'll tell you why Samsung is in a very precarious position here they were very quick to want to take the crown for being the first company to have ai they very much do not want to be the first company to talk about the downside that comes with that AI do you remember the launch of the Xbox One the single launch that you could argue destroyed Xbox's entire console business the company essentially told people how they were going to restrict the sharing of video games in this generation of consoles how if I buy one game that game becomes tied to my account and I can't give or even lend it to a friend and by revealing their intention First Sony their key rival was able to see that everyone responded absolutely terribly to that decision to realize that no one wanted anything to do with this new Xbox because of it and then all son he had to do was to step in and tell people that to share discs on the PlayStation you just had to hand it from one person to the next in one Fell Swoop the console war was practically over and that is the exact situation that Samsung is trying to avoid here let's be honest every one of these companies wants to charge you for AI but if Samsung goes first then it leaves the floor open for other companies to either come in and charge way less than Samsung to steal their Thunder or even just straight up troll the company by keeping theirs free for another year so I'm convinced that Samsung is waiting for someone else to say something but still these guys withholding this information is very much putting their business in front of their users at this point less than a year before they're saying that you're about to be charged they should be making it very clear how much and of course then we've got the cameras and I'd actually go as far as to say that there are large improvements to the cameras this year the s25 ultra does take better Zoom photos than last year it takes better Ultra wide shots it's got better skin tones pretty much every single image taken on every single lens is sharper and the videos look cleaner with less noise too not to mention that it now shoots fast enough that I would go as far as to say Samsung's 5 plus year battle with shutter lag I'd say it's finally put to bed I wouldn't say this is the best phone camera ever I'd say the iPhone is a little ahead the Vivo X200 Pro is quite away ahead but it's still top five again though to the point that I'm making most of these improvements have happened with without any change to the camera Hardware from last year so another one of the reasons that I'm suggesting you might want to wait this one out is to see if this camera can get so much better without changing the cameras then is this again just software and are they going to bring these improvements to their previous phones I mean I'd say there's at least a 50% chance that they don't they might either decide that if we make our old phones better no one's going to buy the new ones or there's just a limit to how much they can improve the last ones because these improvements rest on the more intelligent AI CES of the new chipset so to bring this all together if you're getting a new Android right now and all you want is just to buy the best phone there is then this is absolutely one of the phones that you should be looking at there's very little wrong with it apart from some room for improvement with the camera and some wonky AI features but if you're looking at it from the lens of value then it's really hard to say that this phone is better value than last year's phone since most of the best things about it are already on that phone coming to that phone or should be coming to that phone and a lot of the things that aren't are going to be charged for so how can I say say yes you should go out and buy this before we know how much we're going to be charged for to make the most of it oh yeah and we can't forget the fastest way to make friends and our sponsor surf shark VPN because here's the thing almost every single VPN has a cap you might be able to share your login with two people five people seven people with Sur shark VPN one subscription gets VPN access to you your buddies and your entire city if you want it to it's the most stable VPN I've used the app just works whether you're on your phone or your computer and it's one of the most useful Swiss Army knif tools to have in your back pocket it can make websites that were previously misbehaving just suddenly start working again it can let you watch streaming content from other countries it can make your computer think you're back home even when you're away somewhere so you don't have to keep endlessly re authenticating your accounts the list goes on all topped off with the fact that the value proposition has just gotten even better with the code boss it's now $2 a month with an extra 4 months for free and a 30-day money back guarantee\n"

It offers an addictively delightful user experience and is considered the closest competitor to the iPhone. However, despite its appeal, the recommendation is to hold off on purchasing it for now. A significant aspect of its appeal is tied to new AI features, which are currently free until the end of 2025, but the future cost of these features is uncertain.\""
